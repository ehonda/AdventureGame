# Adventure Game

Welcome to the Adventure Game repository! This game was created entirely using ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. All of the files, including the code and the README, were generated by ChatGPT.

## Game Description

In this game, you are a trespasser in the territory of the AI overlord. You must answer the AI's questions correctly to survive. Answer enough questions correctly, and you will win the game. Answer one incorrectly, and you will be terminated.
